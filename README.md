# Food Finder
This is a javascript portfolio demonstration by Kevin Cartwright.
Food Finder uses the Google Places API to quickly generate a list of nearby
restaurants, with a little help from jQuery and your browsers Geolocation feature.

Food Finder is hosted with Heroku, on a basic Node.js server running Express.

Food Finder is work in progress, so thank you for sending feedback to 123foodfinder@gmail.com
