# Food Finder
This is a javascript portfolio demonstration by Kevin Cartwright.
Food Finder uses the Google Places API to quickly generate a list of nearby
restaurants, with a little help from jQuery and your browser's Geolocation feature.

Feel free to use this as a starting place for building a Node.js Express app that calls the Google Places API.
You will find the code for making the API call in /routes, 'gcall.js'.

I have an example of this code running on Heroku at:
https://kevincartwright.herokuapp.com/

In order to get this to work on your own system, you will need to request an API key from Google here:
https://console.developers.google.com

Your unique API key should be entered immediately after the value 'API_KEY=' in a filed named '.env' on the server root. This file is included in .gitignore for your convenience.

Start the server with 'npm start' command on the command line from the server root and direct your browser to 'localhost:5000'.

Food Finder is work in progress, so thank you for sending feedback to 123foodfinder@gmail.com
